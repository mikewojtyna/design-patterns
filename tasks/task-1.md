# CrowdSorcery API components

## Your task
Design API services implementing critical business processes. The draft of the services is created for you. You just need to fill in the details: method arguments and return values.

### Solution
You can find solutions in the `solutions.crowdsorcery.task1` package.

## Discussion
- What do you think of your design?
- Do you think this API will hold for a long time?
- Do you prefer to design your systems from the top or from the bottom?
