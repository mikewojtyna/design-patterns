# Borrowers Registry Singleton

Take a look at Borrowers Registry in the `problems.crowdsorcery.task2.service` package. Next, run the corresponding `problems.crowdsorcery.task2.BorrowersRestTest` and try to make it pass. Consider using the Singleton pattern. For the needs of this task, consider using the implementation that uses the single instance for entire JVM.

What problems do you see with the current implementation? How would you fix them? What's your implementation of the Singleton pattern? Are there any other flavours of the Singleton pattern you're aware of? What are their pros and cons?

You can find solutions in the `solutions.crowdsorcery.task2` package. You can follow the `SingletonPattern` annotation to see how it can be implemented using different approaches.
